CS7642 Reinforcement Learning Course Project Three


## File structure:
#### (1) All codes are written in python 3.4.
#### (2) 8 ".py" files in total. Four learning algorithms. Each algorithm has two python files: "play_name of method.py" and "soccer_env_name of method.py". The "soccer_env_xxxx.py" contains implmentation of Agent and Game classes, and a individual function for linear programming.

## Run code:
#### (3) To run each algorithm, two corresponding files should be put together. And run the "play_xxx.py" file.
#### (4) Required packages include numpy, math, matplotlib, copy, random, cvxopt.
